# front-glue
Ready to use Front-End boilerplate based on ES6 and PostCSS (and Webpack)

## Installing
```bash
npm install
```

## Running
Replace files in `./scripts` and `./styles` directories.

* `npm run build.dev` will build dev version of the source
* `npm run build.prog` will build production version of the source

Alternatively you can use the following commands for watching the files and
rebuilding them automatically:

* `npm run watch.dev` will build dev version of the source
* `npm run watch.prog` will build production version of the source

Output files are put in `./build` direcotry.
